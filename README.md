# FileViewer

A simple desktop reading application.

## What does it do?

It's a desktop markdown file viewing application. I made this program because I
am currently taking a class that provides markdown files as additional course
content. I don't want to open VSCode and use an extension just to read my files.

Currently, it is capable of performing the following:

- Opening markdown files for viewing
- Page switching to switch between recently opened files (from current session)

What I'd like to include in the future:

- Restore recently opened files session to future sessions
- Quick edit feature, for when malformed markdown is noticed

### Demo
